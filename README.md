# MCPI-Stuff
Stuff and mods for MCPI

In the python file named "PBNT.py", there are two possible commands which you can use:
  save:
The "save" command saves your current location in MCPI and uploades it to a text document with a very long name.

  load:
The "load" command loads all of your saves from MCPI.  Enter in the number of which your save is located in the file - like an array string (0 is first save, 1 is second save and so on).  Note that, while saves will work on all MCPI maps, they will only take you to your designated area on one map.
Both commands are in lowercase.
